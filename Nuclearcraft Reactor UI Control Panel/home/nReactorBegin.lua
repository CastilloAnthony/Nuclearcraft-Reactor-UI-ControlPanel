	Designed and tested for use with OpenComputers-MC1.12.2-1.7.4.153.jar and NuclearCraft-2.17c-1.12.2.jar.
	This is still a work in progress so any suggestions will be taken into consideration.
	Email suggesttions to Cao21745@yahoo.com
	This script will be an alternative file for folks who just want to run the script without a "fancy" UI.
	Simply ensure you have placed this and the other files into the home directory of the computer and then
	type in the name "nReactorBegin" without the ".lua" and it will begin automating a reactor with a 
	simplified UI.
