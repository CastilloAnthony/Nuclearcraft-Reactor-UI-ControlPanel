# Nuclearcraft-Reactor-UI-ControlPanel

	Developed by Anthony Castillo (Cao21745) 2/23/2020
	Designed and tested for use with OpenComputers-MC1.12.2-1.7.4.153.jar and NuclearCraft-2.17c-1.12.2.jar.
	This is still a work in progress so any suggestions will be taken into consideration.

	This is a simple program that is designed to automatically control a Nuclearcraft Reactor while drawing
	a fairly simple UI.
	It currently draws a power level bar and a heat level bar.
	Additionally it'll label the name of the currently processing FUEL, the power output of the reactor,
	it's efficiency, remaining burn time and the reactor's currently stored power.
	The script also has a builtin screen timeout, using either a motion sensor or a touch event to wake the
	screen back up. The script is still monitoring the reactor while the screen UI is off.
	
	Planned Feature:
	-Touch screen buttons!
		-An on/off switch with a better indicator for whether the reactor is on or off. (Thinking big green or red button)
